<p>This package provides a query API for <b>panFMP</b>.</p>

<h2>Important notice</h2>
<p>Recently, the implementation of <strong>panFMP</strong>'s {@linkplain org.apache.lucene.search.trie fast range-queries}
was given to the <em>Apache Software Foundation</em> as contribution to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/" target="_blank">Apache Lucene</a> and was removed from
current <strong>panFMP</strong> (see the corresponding <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1470" target="_blank">JIRA issue 1470</a>).
It will be included into <b>Lucene 2.9</b>. By this it is possible for other projects, to use this great toolkit.
The current snapshot version of <b>Lucene</b> is bundled with <b>panFMP</b>.</p>
<p>Because of that classes <code>de.pangaea.metadataportal.search.TrieRangeQuery</code> and <code>de.pangaea.metadataportal.utils.TrieUtils</code> were
removed from <b>panFMP</b> and included into <b>Lucene's contrib package &quot;Queries&quot;</b>. The documentation can be found
{@linkplain org.apache.lucene.search.trie here}.</p>

Harvester:
* Completely rebuilding index from source without deleting old one having readers online (new commit lock-less usage!)
* Compression on/off for XML stored
* Assigning of document boosts by number datatype XPath (complicated XPathes?) or some other combination
  (assigning values to boolean type XPath, go through XPath list until one matches)

Search:
* New Search API:
  - Optional usage of default lucene "Query" classes when requesting search results
  - split AXIS api from generic API
